## NextLearning web client

This project is orignally intended to serve as a socket client. Socket client is used for realtime presentation of the friends' online/offline status. 
Test with multiple clients and observe the behavior surely helps me and my team. 
Login with one of the friend account and toggle the online and offline with the simple button fixes bug related to the broadcast event.


After time goes by, there is demand for more complex features to be demonstrate. 
So i decide to clone the actual application i am devloping. 
My system design is applied to this project first and then introduced to the others. 
Always there is uncertain of what i designed and often i got request for edit the system from the app developer.
I feel sorry for them not consider their situations.


This project requires me to work more than what i expected but gives me the following advantages:

- Ability to design more mobile friendly backend
- Can manage and visualize life cycle of data and logic
- Got insight about the mobile backend and app development
